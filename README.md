# CLI Car Booking Application

## Initial Implementation

As an admin for a car company I would like to have system to book cars and view users.

When booking a new car the applicattion should ask for:
* Car id to be available (which must be generated by the system)
* User id (which must be generated by the system)

**Note: An user only can have one car booked**

### We will also ensure that:
* We use OOP
* We separate our domain from the business logic
* We use packages to organize our code
* We use the right naming conventions for classes, methods and packages

IMPORTANT - You must use Arrays to hold any data. Do not use Lists at this point. We will later.

IMPORTANT - Do not use dependency injection just yet. We will later

Our application must display a menu like that:

```
1️⃣ - Book Car
2️⃣ - View All Users Booked Car
3️⃣ - View All Bookings
4️⃣ - View Available Cars
5️⃣ - View Available Electric Cars
6️⃣ - View all users
7️⃣ - Exit
```
