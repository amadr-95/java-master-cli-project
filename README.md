# CLI Car Booking Application

## Initial Implementation (advanced)

As an admin for a car company I would like to have system to book cars and view users.

When booking a new car the applicattion should ask for:

* Car id to be available (which must be generated by the system)
* User id (which must be generated by the system)

**Note: In this version an user can have multiple cars booked**

IMPORTANT - You must use Arrays to hold any data. Do not use Lists at this point. We will later.

IMPORTANT - Do not use dependency injection just yet. We will later

I have also added some extra options such as:

```
1️⃣ - Book Car
2️⃣ - View Car Booked By User
3️⃣ - View All Bookings
4️⃣ - View Available Cars
5️⃣ - View Available Electric Cars
6️⃣ - **Add New Car**
7️⃣ - View All Users
8️⃣ - **Add New User**
9️⃣ - Exit
```
